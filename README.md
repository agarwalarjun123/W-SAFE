## Problem Statement:
## Public safety using modern technology

## Problem Statistics:
According to the report and data:

•  38 percent of attempted abductions occurred while a child was walking to or from school, riding a school bus or riding a bicycle

•  37 percent occurred between 2 and 7 p.m. on a weekday

•  43 percent involved children ages 10 through 14

•  72 percent of attempted abduction victims were female
Main Idea
The main idea is to use everyday wearable devices like FItBit and MiBand for public safety.

We propose the following points:

We will monitor the location of the device at all times to train a model with the frequent paths that a person takes.
 If a person is late, we would know the first place to look for

 If someone looses an item, they can trace their path.

2. People can manually set their destinations, and on deviating from that waypoint, an alarm will trigger. If the alarm is not disarmed (By authentication) in a few seconds, then all listed emergency contacts will recieve a notification.

3. The band can detect pressure. So if a person is drowning, an alarm will be set off. This will give the listed contact informtion about the ocurence of the event and the location, so they can call the authorities.

4. Haptic feedback on the band will be used for 2 main purposes:

 -  Haptic feedback will let the person in distress know that help  is on the way

 -  Haptic feedback will be triggered once an emergency contact is near the person ( range can be changed ). So in case a person is trapped somewhere and they know there loved ones are close, they can shout for help.

5. We can train a model according to the heart-rate of the specific user. If we see ranges of huge spikes in heart rate, we can trigger an alarm, which, if not switched off in a few seconds, will notify emergency contacts.

6. The application will have a safe mode, which will turn off all alarms and tracking systems.
